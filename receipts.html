            <p class="innhold">With todays commercial model every time you buy a product you will get a receipt written on paper.<br> 
                    Not only is it hard to keep track of the small pieces of paper, but it also has a huge environmental effect. <br>
                    The US prints receipts worth 640.000 tons of paper each year, or equivalent to 9.6 million trees being cut down. <br>
                    Of course you could just say no thank you to the receipt, but at the same time you will resign all your warranty rights. <br>
           <br>Surely, there must be a better way?</p>
